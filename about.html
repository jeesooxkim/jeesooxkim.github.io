  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a programmer by craft, but priorities reside beyond coding.
    <br><br>
    For software engineers who love art like me, this is a heart-racing time to be alive. 
    There's an incredulous load of topics to explore and polish, whether that be in the AR / XR / VR,
    gaming, or film spaces. Seamless realistic and stylistic graphics engineering for jaw-dropping textures,
    movement, lighting, etc. are some of the most difficult engineering problems the industry faces today.
    Yet, this is also one of the most visually satisfying problem spaces as a creative in programming.
    <br><br>
    But what's the mission of it all? The technologies we create are only as good as the mission
    of the people behind the screens. Personally, I want to develop artistically
    intriguing projects through which deeply believable and emotionally diverse stories can
    be told. I want my work to reach people, to bring empathy and excitement to the furthest
    and darkest corners of the world, and help them see even a glimpse of hope. What better way
    to do this than to take part in the visual adventure of storytelling?
    <br><br>
    With that, this site hosts graphics, animation, and associated concepts that I have been learning.
    I hope that you find some interesting topics and/or projects that spark your curiosity as well.
    <br><br>
    Beyond animation, graphics, and art, I have a deep seated obsession with coffee, love
    to play my guitar and sing, and dream of exploring new cities, cultures, and the
    great outdoors. So let me know if you want coffee equipment recs, want to come over
    to hang and in-house karaoke with me, or also share my bucket list item of seeing the
    northern lights!
