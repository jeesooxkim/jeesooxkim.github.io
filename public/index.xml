      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>A separate topic that Wayne emphasized in his webinar was &amp;ldquo;subtext.&amp;rdquo; Using the pigeon encounter scene from Bolt and Elsa&amp;rsquo;s crown throwing scene from Frozen, Wayne showed his detailed analysis on the connection the character&amp;rsquo;s expression has with their internal emotion - not with the external dialogue itself.
For instance, breaking down the scene from Frozen, a frame by frame observation of Elsa&amp;rsquo;s face provides a massive amount of insight into what our mind is subconsciously processing.</description>

      <description>Rise Up Animation has been hosting some amazing webinars to help jumpstart various animation lovers into the industry. A recent talk hosted Wayne Unten, a character animator at Disney Animation - most people these days know him as the character lead on Elsa from the Frozen movies.
You could catch glimpses of Wayne&amp;rsquo;s passion on the &amp;ldquo;Making of Frozen II&amp;rdquo; series on Disney+. As I watched the first episode begin to unravel the depths of animated feature film development, the tone of the show came to a gentle stand still, mid-breath suspension as Wayne described the particular hall in the studios that housed framed letters from some of their viewers.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
