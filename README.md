Welcome to my personal website! Here I keep track of upcoming personal projects, and also showcase those projects and curiosities. Head over to my site to see what I've been up to, or check out my repo management and investigate the linked projects, here on my git profile. I do progress tracking and issue breakdowns via GitHub Projects, so feel free to check that out.

This site is built using Jekyll.

Credit goes to [jekyll-theme-persephone](https://github.com/erlzhang/jekyll-theme-persephone) which provided the base theme I built off of.
