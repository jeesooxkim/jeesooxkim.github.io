Hello! Thanks for stopping by. Here's a cup of coffee for the trouble.

I'm a programmer by craft, but my interests are... somewhat beyond coding.

For software engineers who love art like me, this is an incredible time to be alive. Hyper-realistic and stylized graphics for jaw-dropping textures, movement, lighting, etc. are cutting-edge developments that affect a huge range of fields including AR / XR / VR, gaming, and film. It's cool that these _also_ happen to be some of the most difficult engineering problems!

Technical awe aside, my dream is to develop artistically novel tools that enable the creation of deeply believable, beautiful, and diverse stories. 

On this site, I showcase graphics, animation, and associated concepts that I have been learning and building. I hope that you'll find some interesting topics and/or projects that spark your curiosity as well.


# Obligatory Hobbies Section

I also...
- have a deep obsession with coffee
- love music (guitar, ukulele-ing, singing, listening very loudly)
- am always traveling to different cities and national parks
- love running! (not in the Texas heat though)

Let me know if you want coffee equipment recs, want to come over for some in-house karaoke, or have beaten me to seeing the northern lights :(

# Say hello!
Thanks for waving back! Drop a note if you have a second -- I find that people who wave back are usually pretty great people.

I'm always open to meeting new friends and talking about cool ideas, whether it be professional or just about coffee and my/your cat.
