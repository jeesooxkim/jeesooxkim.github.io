A separate topic that Wayne emphasized in his webinar was "subtext." Using the pigeon encounter scene from Bolt and Elsa's crown throwing scene from Frozen, Wayne showed his detailed analysis on the connection the character's expression has with their internal emotion - not with the external dialogue itself.

For instance, breaking down the scene from Frozen, a frame by frame observation of Elsa's face provides a massive amount of insight into what our mind is subconsciously processing. The transition from furrowed eyebrows with anger, to the subtle tightening of grip, then the spark of realization that she can be free, followed by the smallest smirk flitting by through her determined grin, up until the forceful toss of the delicate crown is a full montage of Elsa's internal growth. This all happens within the lyric "I'm never going back, the past is in the past."

The sheer details that goes into creating these sequences is what drives the believability and intense connection that we feel towards these characters. Most of it goes unnoticed due to the swift pacing, but what goes unnoticed is the key to our brains experiencing rich, human-like emotion processing.

As a reference, Wayne recommended "Peoplewatching" by Desmond Morris and "The Human Face" by Brian Bates. They are in my queue to check out - I will post cool concepts learned from these books as well.
