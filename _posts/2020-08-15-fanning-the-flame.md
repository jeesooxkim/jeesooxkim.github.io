Rise Up Animation recently hosted **Wayne Unten**, a character animator at Disney Animation Studios --- most people these days know him as the character lead on Elsa from the Frozen movies. 

You can catch glimpses of Wayne's passion on the <ins>Making of Frozen II</ins> docuseries on Disney+. Wayne walks through a hall in the studio which houses some framed letters from their viewers, and the tone of the moment immediately shifts. He reads one letter from a young suicidal girl, who was encouraged and inspired by Elsa to let her burdens go, and live another day. He chokes up.

The same kind of mission showed in Wayne's eyes during the webinar, as he told the story of a man who had suffered a substantial and externally visible head injury. Although this man's daily life is undeniably impaired, one of the few normal things he can do as a family activity with his kids is to go to a dark movie theater to watch animated films.

It is a great privilege to be able to deliver hope and joy to people through what we create.

Wayne helped me put why I love this field into words. Animation is a medium through which one can invoke empathy and inspiration for perhaps the widest range of audiences. Even as adults, we are pulled into Disney narratives --- we resonate with the deep moral questions and inner conflicts that the characters face. With the help of the exaggerated nature of animated facial expressions and actions, we get a transparent, vulnerable, and intense view of the characters' emotional responses.

We watch Anton Ego's flashback to his childhood in **Ratatouille**, and witness exactly how his stubborn worldview is shattered. We see the square that is Carl in **Up**, how he is rounded and softened out by Ellie, then left with a unspeakable hollowness once she has gone. A heart-broken Bing Bong in **Inside Out** is comforted by Sadness, and we realize the ever important role that Sadness plays in our own lives.

In moments like these, we find ourselves understood in the most personal of spaces; spaces we haven't even shared with our closest loved ones. We are given permission, not only to feel what the characters are feeling, but also to feel vulnerable ourselves.

I've only recently given myself permission to finally pursue this seemingly elusive field of animation. And as I tune into these talks, however, the world of animation seems to greet me with open arms. The passion I have for hope-inspiring storytelling continues to grow, and for the first time in a long while, I'm excited to wake up every morning.

There's just so much to be learned, seen, and done.
