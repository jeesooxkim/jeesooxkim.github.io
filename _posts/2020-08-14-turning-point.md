Software engineering is overrated.

I've been working as a developer for the past year, which has been extremely educational and interesting. Working with state-of-the-art AI algorithms and learning the software release procedures of a multi-billion dollar company that is literally a century old? My hands and mind have truly been busy.

Yet as the initial buzz of excitement dissipated, the days in which I simply lacked the motivation to work were undeniably becoming more common. It was easy convince myself that it was "part of the career climbing process" and that the soul-sucking sensation "was just a phase."

As I trudged through the work days, I found solace in my after work hours. Since I was a child, my mind was unstoppably curious. As I grew older, this manifested into a state of constant self-learning - including playing the mellophone, guitar, ukulele, and piano, drawing photorealistic pencil portraits, crocheting, embroidering, Arduino wiring and programming, vocal training, bouldering, distance-running, photography, website building, and the list goes on and on. I was always looking for the next new thing to dive into.

Years later, the influx of new hobbies had finally been slowing down, and I have settled upon developing my singing and guitar (particularly fingerstyle), drawing, bouldering, running, and a heavy investment into espresso and wine. 

I spent many hours drawing and singing my dissatisfaction in work away. It wasn't until one day, when I was still doodling away on Procreate in bed as the sun began to rise, did I realize that something was gravely wrong with this picture.

My heart thrived the most when I let myself be creative. No wonder I was dreading the cog-in-the-corporate-machine 9 to 5 work hours - I had felt so trapped taking GitHub issue after issue completing tasks that contributed to a subpar product, surrounded by people who were simply happy about their paychecks. I felt ungrateful, but I wanted more than just coding.

The reason why I fell in love with coding when I made my very first tic-tac-toe game out of Java my freshman spring of college was because I had created something out of thin air. I could interact and customize my creation to an infinite extent. Essentially I was presented with a task where it was simply impossible to be bored, since the things I could create had no boundaries. This was where I could create (and make money while doing it).

Everything has been coming pointing to this direction, with little crumbs along the way like reading how Prof. Randy Pausch achieved his childhood dreams of working at Disney Imagineering, snooping around Maya and Blender, talking to the Imagineers at the GHC '18 Disney booth, binge watching the Imagineering story, and finally being fully encouraged to stop wasting my time hoping for things to get better, and to pursue what I know has always been on my mind.

Computer graphics.

This is how I begin my relentless and commmited journey into the topic I find the most intriguing. This is also the turning point to where I no longer doubt whether I am capable of achieving my dreams, because it doesn't matter whether I can or cannot - I simply must.

George Lucas had the right idea when he wrote Yoda. "Do or do not, there is no try."
