I love coffee and animation. I also happened to be lucky enough to really enjoy coding, so my parents narrowly escaped the stress of their child running off to art school. Instead, I'm intrigued by computer graphics, AI, as well as AR / XR / VR.  

Hope you learn a random thing or two here, and follow me along as I journey through the endless facets of graphics.
